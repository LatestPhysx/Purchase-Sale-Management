A Simple C# .Net Framework And SSMS Windows App That Manages Purchases And Sales For A Company.

 

This Was Done Using The Help Of [ReaLTaiizor](https://github.com/Taiizor/ReaLTaiizor).


To Make This Work You Need To Do Some Steps (Idk If It Can Run Without These Steps But Iif It Doesn't This) :
1- Go To Csharp/packages/ReaLTaiizor.3.8.1.1 And Unarchive lib.7z and ReaLTaiizor.3.8.1.1.nupkg.7z and put the contents of those archives in ReaLTaiizor.3.8.1.1 Folder (this was done so i can upload this to github)
2- Try To Run the project, if its shows a error you can clean and suppress errors.
3- it should run now
